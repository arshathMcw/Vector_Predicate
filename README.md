## Hello Everyone , In this Repo I am learning about predication and with the help of that going to implement different patterns
1. Store The element Not divisable by vector type length : [click here](./load_and_store.cpp)
1. Create a vector of integers and use a predicate to replace all negative numbers with zero : [click here](replace_negative_with_zeros.cpp)
1. Use a predicate to add only positive values from B to A : [click here](./add_only_positive.cpp)
