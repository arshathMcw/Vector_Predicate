## Hello Everyone , In this Repo I am learning about predication and with the help of that going to implement different patterns
1. Store The element Not divisable by vector type length : [click here](./load_and_store.cpp)
1. Create a vector of integers and use a predicate to replace all negative numbers with zero : [click here](replace_negative_with_zeros.cpp)
1. Use a predicate to add only positive values from B to A : [click here](./add_only_positive.cpp)
1. Multiply only even numbers in A by their corresponding values in B : [click here](./multiply_even_number.cpp)
    ```
    Multiply The matrix 1 value with matrx 2 only when the value in matrix 1 is even  , othherwise just store the value only in matrix 1
    Matrix1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    Matrix2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
    Output = [1, 40, 3, 160, 5, 360, 7, 640]
    ```
