## Hello Everyone , In this Repo I am learning about predication and with the help of that going to implement different patterns
1. Store The element Not divisable by vector type length : [click here](./load_and_store.cpp)
1. Create a vector of integers and use a predicate to replace all negative numbers with zero.
